## 📖 About

**The Dev-sumer Manifesto** is a call to action for architects, engineers, and designers who refuse to be passive consumers of software. It's about:

- **Reclaiming agency** over our tools and workflows
- **Protecting human time** and fighting toxic productivity culture
- **Building tools that encode our values**: efficiency, humanity, respect
- **Sharing knowledge** openly through commons licenses
- **Creating communities** where innovation compounds

> *"These principles belong to anyone willing to act on them. Adapt them to your context, share them with your community, build on them freely—but acknowledge the philosophical foundation."*

## 🎯 The Fifteen Principles

A manifesto without principles is just rhetoric. Here are the fifteen principles that define the Dev-sumer approach:

1. **Tools Are Not Neutral** - Software embeds assumptions; build your own values
2. **The Boundary Between Designer and Tool-Maker Is Artificial** - Thinking makes you capable
3. **Building Tools Is Design Research** - Formalize thinking, improve practice
4. **Start With the Problem, Not the Tool** - Vision drives tools, not vice versa
5. **Automate Toil, Not Thinking** - Eliminate tedious work to focus on creative thinking
6. **Make Your Tools Shareable** - Knowledge grows when shared
7. **Embrace Imperfect Tools Over Perfect Workflows** - 80% solution beats manual process
8. **Learn Enough to Be Dangerous** - Solve immediate problems, depth comes with practice
9. **Build Iteratively, Not Monumentally** - Solve today's problem, improve tomorrow
10. **The Tool Is the Message** - Share ways of thinking, teach by demonstrating
11. **Leadership Must Evolve With Technology** - Recognize uniqueness, orchestrate harmony
12. **Protect Human Time Fiercely** - Time = dignity, not just efficiency
13. **Combine Disciplines for Creativity** - Innovation lives at intersections
14. **Stay Human in the Age of AI** - Remember the human element
15. **Cultivate Passion and Curiosity** - The fuel for continuous growth
